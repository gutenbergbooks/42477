<h4><em>A Midsummer Day-dream, and its waking Sequel.</em></h4></div>

<p>It was the luncheon-hour at Lord's. Likewise it was exceeding hot, and Mr. <span class="sc">Punch</span>, after an exciting morning's cricket,
was endeavouring to cool himself with an iced tankard, a puggreed "straw," and a fragrant whiff.</p>

<p>"Willow the King!" piped Mr. <span class="sc">Punch</span>, pensively. "Quite so! A merrier monarch than the Second <span class="sc">Charles</span> is
<span class="sc">William</span> (<span class="sc">Gilbert</span>) the very First! And no one kicks at King Willow, even in these democratic days. The verdant, smooth-shaven
lawn, when wickets are pitched, is your very best 'leveller'&mdash;in one sense, though, in another, what stylish <span class="sc">Richard
Daft</span> calls 'Kings of Cricket' ('by merit raised to that <em>good</em> eminence'), receive the crowd's loyal and most enthusiastic homage.
But, by Jove, the Harrow boys will want a new version of their favourite cricket song, if prodigy be piled on prodigy, like
Pelion on Ossa, in the fashion to which the Doctor during the first month of Summer in this year of Grace has accustomed us."</p>

<p>"The 'Doctor's' throne has never been disputed by anyone outside Bedlam," said a strong and sonorous voice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Punch</span> looked up, and perceived before him a stalwart six-footer in flannels, broad-belted at the equator, and
wearing broad-brim'd silken stove-pipe.</p>

<p>"<span class="sc">Alfred Mynn</span>, quoting 'the Old Buffer,' or I'm a Dutchman," said the omniscient and ever-ready one.</p>

  <div class="poem width30">
    <div class="stanza">
<p>"'And, whatever fame and glory these and other bats may win,</p>
<p>Still the monarch of hard hitters, to my mind, was <span class="sc">Alfred Mynn</span>;</p>
<p>With his tall and stately presence, with his nobly-moulded form,</p>
<p>His broad hand was ever open, his brave heart was ever warm'&mdash;</p>
      </div>
	</div>

<p>as <span class="sc">Prowse</span> sang pleasantly."</p>

<p>The Kentish Titan blushed&mdash;if Shades can with modesty suffuse. "You know <em>everything</em>, of course, Mr. <span class="sc">Punch</span>,"
said he; "and therefore you know that the object of my visit is <em>not</em> to have my praises sung even by you or the Poet <span class="sc">Prowse</span>,
but to back up that National Testimonial to <em>the</em> Cricketer of the century&mdash;and the 'centuries'&mdash;of which I'm glad to hear
whispers in the Elysian Fields, where&mdash;alas!&mdash;we do <em>not</em> pitch the stumps or chase the flying 'leathery duke' of Harrow
song."</p>

<p>"Well, it's a far cry from Hambledon to Downend," quoth Mr. <span class="sc">Punch</span>, pensively; "but even the gods of 'the
Hambledon Pantheon,' as picturesque <span class="sc">John Nyren</span> called them, might have admitted the Downend Doctor as their Jove.
Or, adopting his other figure, have made him the King <span class="sc">Arthur</span> of their Round Table, <em>vice</em> old <span class="sc">Richard Nyren</span> retired."</p>

<p>"I see you read what is worth reading," responded the Kentish Big 'Un. "<span class="sc">Dick Nyren's</span> style was as sound and
honest and brisk as the English ale he lauded,&mdash;'barleycorn, such as would put the soul of three butchers into one weaver.'
But the great Gloucestershire gentleman is worthy to bend the bow of Ulysses."</p>

<p>"Or to wear the pads of <span class="sc">Alfred Mynn</span>, which, I believe, were presented to him," said Mr. <span class="sc">Punch</span>, cordially.</p>

<p>"Ah! There is another and a bigger Presentation afoot, I understand, thanks largely to a truly Gracious Prince,"
returned "the monarch of hard hitters." "A knighthood? Well, that's as it may be! Quite deserved indeed; but a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiv" id="pageiv"></a>[pg iv]</span>
'King' hardly needs the addition of the lesser honour, and indeed W. G. won his spurs on the tented field years and years
agone. But a National Testimonial! Faith, the Briton who grudges a subscription to <em>that</em> doesn't deserve to see a sixer run
out, or drink a flagon of genuine Boniface at the 'Bat and Ball' on Broad Halfpenny. Only wish we old willow-wielders in
the Elysian Fields could contribute each our obolus. By Castor and Pollux, here he comes!"</p>

<p>Broad, bronzed, black-bearded, bear-pawed, bell-mouthed, beaming, in loose-cut flannels and M. C. C. cap, the
redoubtable Doctor entered. 'Twas a sight to see those two six-foot-odders shake hands! And to hear the talk of the
Cricket Heroes of two generations&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*</p>

<p>"Hillo, Mr. <span class="sc">Punch</span>! Wake up, old man! Match over!"</p>

<p>It was the veritable voice of the Gloucester Giant. But where was the Pride of Kent? He came like a shadow
in summer slumber, and so departed. But <span class="sc">William Gilbert</span> was at least satisfactorily solid.</p>

<p>"Where are the Bats of yester year?" murmured the drowsy Sage.</p>

<p>"Oh, still scoring&mdash;some of 'em," said the practical smiter, cheerfully. "Keeping up a fair average, too."</p>

<p>"What is yours just now, Doctor?"</p>

<p>"Oh, ask <span class="sc">Druce</span>! <em>His</em> tops it, I believe&mdash;for the present."</p>

<p>"Ah, well! But the Century of Centuries, the Thousand of Merry May, the suggested knighthood, the coming
National Testimonial, H. R. H.'s letter&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I never saw a nicer letter, and I hope to see as good wherever I go," interrupted the modest and taciturn giant,
with a grin reminiscent of <em>Wickets in the West</em> and "the rapt oration flowing free," in a fourfold iteration of a single
sentence.</p>

<p>"Better <em>before</em> the stump than <em>on</em> it, eh, <span class="sc">William</span>?" smiled the Sage, who had read his rollicking <span class="sc">R. A. Fitzgerald</span>,
and understood W. G.'s allusion. "Unlike the <em>other</em> W. G., at present out in the Baltic."</p>

<p>"Ah, <em>he</em> could give the bowling beans, in his own way, which certainly isn't mine," said the Man of Many Centuries.</p>

<p>"What a season!" exclaimed Mr. <span class="sc">Punch</span>, preparing to puff.</p>

But even <em>he</em> never hit his hundred hundreds, though he played up to the age of fifty. Well, <span class="sc">William</span> mine, you've topped
the toppers and cut all records. May the National Testimonial do likewise. Wish you a sovereign reward for every good
hit with which you've pleased the populace&mdash;a '<em>quid</em>' for every <em>quo</em>. And, to prove the sincerity of my love and admiration
for the greatest Cricketer of all time, I propose, my dear (prospective) Sir <span class="sc">William Gilbert Grace</span>, K.G. (Knight of

<div class="poem width33">  <div class="stanza">
<p class="i8">So, 'Ninety-Five, my boy, you've come at last!</p>
<p class="i10">Another year has gone, and I am here</p>
<p class="i8">To greet you, as your brothers in the past</p>
<p class="i10">Were greeted on their coming, year by year;</p>
<p>For it's always been my practice, Sir&mdash;a bit of <em>Punch's</em> lore&mdash;</p>
<p>Since the day that I was volumed, until now I'm fifty-four</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i8">Aye, fifty-three New Years I've welcomed. This</p>
<p class="i10">I pray to Heaven in its arms may bear</p>
<p class="i8">A whole New Yearful of a nation's bliss&mdash;</p>
<p class="i10">A world without a tear, without a care.</p>
<p>'Tis thus that I have prayed, young Sir, full many years before;</p>
<p>But to know how oft I've prayed in vain, would make your young heart sore.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i8">The Year that's dead was better, sure, than some;</p>
<p class="i10">But even he brought with him strikes and war,</p>
<p class="i8">Whose ghastly horrors smote the soft heart numb</p>
<p class="i10">And wrung and chilled it to the very core.</p>
<p>'Twas a villainous attention, this suffering and gore,</p>
<p>That we'd rather have dispensed with, from your brother 'Ninety-Four</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i8">But even he, my lad, a jest could work,</p>
<p class="i10">And on occasion smile, and nod, and beck;</p>
<p class="i8">To England gave&mdash;a rising Son of York,</p>
<p class="i10">And gave to Ireland&mdash;Mr. <span class="sc">Gladstone's</span> cheque!</p>
<p>Thus tickling Mr. <span class="sc">Bull</span> from smiles and laughter to a roar.</p>
<p>But hearty laughs like these, my friend, were few in 'Ninety-Four.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i8">And you, young shaver, what is it you bring?</p>
<p class="i10">Razor and soap, like shavers young and old&mdash;</p>
<p class="i8">The soap to soothe, razor to cut and sting?&mdash;</p>
<p class="i10">Will wedding-bell be heard, and death-knell toll'd?</p>
<p>You see, my lad, we're anxious as to what you have in store,</p>
<p>For there's still some things to put to rights bequeathed by Ninety-Four.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i8">In Parliament, no doubt, you'll make your game&mdash;</p>
<p class="i10">In Camp, and Court, and County Council, too?</p>
<p class="i8">Make sport of love&mdash;make foul an honoured name&mdash;</p>
<p class="i10">And all the little fun you're wont to do?</p>
<p>Well&mdash;take my tip. Just do your level best, remember! For</p>
<p>The blame, my son, lies at your own, not <em>Mr. Punch's</em> door.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i8">So mind, young Sir, for <em>Mr. Punch's</em> eye</p>
<p class="i10">Is cocked upon you through your little life.</p>
<p class="i8">Go&mdash;rule the world!&mdash;and if before you die</p>
<p class="i10">You fill the earth with joy instead of strife,</p>
<p>You'll be the first of all your race&mdash;for all the smiles they wore&mdash;</p>
<p>That gave the country what she asked&mdash;from 0 to '94!</p>

<h2>PROTEST FROM THE PLAYGROUND.</h2>

<p>Dear <span class="sc">Mr. Punch</span>,&mdash;I know you sympathise with boys, and isn't
it a jolly shame the masters set us such awfully hard questions in
exams.? My Report has just come home, and my Pater has given
me a fearful rowing, and all because it says "<span class="sc">Wilkins</span> Terts.
(that's me) has done badly in Examinations, and does not take the
trouble to use what intelligence he possesses." My Pater threatens
not to take me to the Pantymime, and I hear it's awfully beefy this
year! Well, we had a "History and General Knowledge" paper,
and one of the questions was this beastly one, and of course I
couldn't tackle it&mdash;"What, or where, are the following:&mdash;'Imperium
in Imperio, The Korea, Bimetallism, The Grand Llama,
Balance of Power, and One Man One Vote?'" I answered all right
about the Korea, because I kicked young <span class="sc">Smith</span> under the table to
give me a tip about it, and he said it was the book the Turks use in
church; and I put that down, but all the other things floored me.
Please will you say what Bimetallism is? <span class="sc">Jones</span> Junior said afterwards,
in the playground, that it was a sort of lozenge, and <span class="sc">Robinson</span>
Senior said he didn't know what it was, but he knew his Pater was
a Bimetallist; and <span class="sc">Jones</span> said <span class="sc">Robinson</span> Senior's Pater must be
a confectioner then; and so <span class="sc">Robinson</span> punched <span class="sc">Jones's</span> head; but
what <em>is</em> it? And is it fair to ask us boys such questions? My
Pater said at breakfast the School Board was fond of sending out
sirkulers. Do you think they would send one to our Head-master,
and ask him to stop such rot?</p>

<h3>SPORT IN COURT;</h3>

<p class="center1"><em>Or, The New Year Dream of the National Anti-Gambling Leaguer.</em></p>

<div class="poem width33">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Oh! it must have been the grog, for I slumbered like a log,</p>
<p class="i2">And I dreamed&mdash;<em>such</em> a dream! I was holding forth in court,</p>
<p>And the prisoners in the dock,&mdash;how the Sporting League 'twould shock!&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">Were the Princes, and the Nobles, and the Leading Lights of Sport.</p>
<p>A supreme, successful raid on the Jockey Club we'd made.</p>
<p class="i2">No mere stuffy, sordid set, of poor betting-men <em>this</em> time,</p>
<p>No cheap winner-spotting snobs, but a lot of topping nobs,</p>
<p class="i2">And I had them on the hip, and I charged the lot with Crime!</p>
<p>It was prime to see a Prince at my language flush and wince,</p>
<p class="i2">And a Lord Chief Justice squirm, and a stern-faced Judge quite blench.</p>
<p><em>But</em>&mdash;I could not fail to mark the demeanour of the Clerk,</p>
<p class="i2">Who looked on it <em>as a lark!</em>&mdash;and that Beak upon the bench&mdash;</p>
<p>Ah! he had a mighty "beak," which I felt a wish to tweak&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">Had a wink in his left eye which seemed frivolous, if funny;</p>
<p>And he didn't seem to suit us, for we wished a stern-faced <span class="sc">Brutus</span>;</p>
<p class="i2">Nay, a ruthless <span class="sc">Rhadamanthus</span> were the big-wig for <em>my</em> money.</p>
<p>Ah! it wanted resolution to conduct that prosecution,</p>
<p class="i2">With a Prince and several Dooks, and an Earl, a County Squire,</p>
<p>And a Mephistopheles, who sat lounging at his ease,</p>
<p class="i2">Whom the culprits all called "<span class="sc">Jimmy</span>," and seemed hugely to admire;</p>
<p>For although I ramped and raved, Beak and Prisoners behaved</p>
<p class="i2">In a fashion which seemed scornful, and assuredly was light;</p>
<p>And that Clerk&mdash;confound his mug, which looked strangely like a pug!&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">And the chap for the defence, with his eyes so brisk and bright,</p>
<p>They seemed all upon the grin, or almost, which was a sin,</p>
<p class="i2">And I'm sure I heard a Dook whisper in a Judge's ear,</p>
<p>"<em>Don't old Mulberry Nose look funny? I will bet you any money</em>&mdash;&mdash;!&mdash;"</p>
<p class="i2">Well, I missed the wager's point; but oh, dear! oh dear!! <em>oh</em> dear!!!</p>
<p>Think of betting&mdash;in a Court! And I thundered against Sport,</p>
<p class="i2">Which meant Gambling, more or less, and red ruin, and disgrace.</p>
<p>From the girls who, though they're loves, wager wickedly&mdash;in gloves,</p>
<p class="i2">To the Plunger Peer who shames his ancient race&mdash;to win a Race.</p>
<p>Ah! I think I "gave them beans." I'm uncertain what that means,</p>
<p class="i2">But the Lord Chief Justice whispered I was doing so&mdash;to "<span class="sc">Jim</span>"&mdash;</p>
<p>And the phrase I overhead, and although it sounds absurd,</p>
<p class="i2">I felt it meant a compliment to me, compelled from him.</p>
<p>So I said "Sport may intrigue and set up a rival League</p>
<p class="i2">To our holy Anti-Gambling One; but Sport is a Foul Sink</p>
<p>We have pledged ourselves to purge with a besom and a scourge&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p class="i2">But here that Punchian eye indulged in a prodigious wink,</p>
<p>Such a spasm of sheer fun, that I felt the case was done;</p>
<p class="i2">Court, Prisoners, Judge, assumed the guise of a colossal Joke!</p>
<p>My head appeared to swim, the wild vision did dislimn,</p>
<p class="i2">And with a shriek of bitter disappointment I&mdash;awoke!</p>

<p class="ind">"<span class="sc">Anglo-Indian.</span>"&mdash;We are indisposed to go the full length of
agreement with the learned Editors of the <em>New English Dictionary</em>
in their study of the derivation of the objectionable word "damn."
In the interesting extract you inclose they remark: "The conjecture
that the word is the Hindi <em>d&#257;m</em>, <em>dawm</em>, an ancient copper coin,
of which 1,600 went to a rupee (see <span class="sc">Yule</span>), is ingenious, but has no
basis in fact." That may be so. It is, nevertheless, a curious coincidence
that at the present time the steady declension of the money
value of the rupee, combined with its immoveable rating in the salary
list, produces in the Civil Service and the army in India a state of
feeling subject to which at least 1,600 dams go to a rupee. We
much fear that, under this provocation, our army in India is able to
compete with regiments earlier enrolled, who, you will remember,
"swore terribly in Flanders."</p>

<h3>THE MODERN THEATRE LAUGH.</h3>
<div class="ind">
<p>Dear <span class="sc">Mr. Punch</span>,&mdash;I crave the hospitality of your columns
under the following circumstances. The other night I went to
a burlesque. Being a man of modest means, I contented myself
with paying half-a-crown, for which sum I was able not only to
sit with the plebs in the pit, but to see Society in the stalls.</p>

<p>Will it be believed, at the end of this so-called nineteenth
century, that songs were sung and things were said which made
those everywhere around me <em>laugh?</em> Sadder still, two-thirds of
those I saw were women!&mdash;women, who are our mothers and
sisters, when they are not our wives and sweethearts!</p>

<p>I haven't the least notion where the harm in all this comes in,
but I'm confident there's some somewhere. In any event it's
a serious sign of the times; which reminds me that I should
have sent this to the <em>Times</em>, if I had not thought the recent
Society-play correspondence sufficient for one season. I'm so
afraid the dear old <em>Thunderer</em> will drop the telegraphic news
and take to <em>Telegraphic</em> Correspondence.</p>

<p>In any case, I invite letters on "The Seriousness of
Laughter."</p>

<h2>THE CHRONICLES OF A RURAL PARISH.</h2>

<p class="title1b">VIII.&mdash;<span class="sc">After the Poll.</span></p>

<p>I am overwhelmed with congratulations, from all classes, from all
sections, from all ranks, and I am acclaimed on all hands as a worthy
head man for a Mudford, if not yet a model, village. Not the least
welcome have been the communications which have reached me
from those who have made my acquaintance in these published
Chronicles. The mayor of a borough whose charter dates well back
into the beginning of the second half of the present century, wrote
to say that he is emboldened by the fact that his wife's maiden
name commenced with a W to write to tell me how rejoiced he is to
hear of my success. A gentleman writes from "The Burning Plains
of the Sahara" to say that he is always proud of the triumphs of a
<span class="sc">Timothy</span>. (My daughter points out that this is clearly a forgery,
since the Sahara mail isn't in till next week. But I can't go into
that.) Then there is a very important letter from Birmingham, of
which I will only say that <span class="sc">Winkins</span>, who has backed many a Bill,
may yet live to indorse a Programme. I may here add that there has
been an attempt in some quarters to decry these Chronicles as
absurd and imaginary. My Birmingham correspondent describes
them as "an important picture of things as they actually are."
He is right. I am as serious as a Prime Minister.</p>

<p>My wife is back&mdash;which reminds me that I received a post-card,
which his had the effect usually produced by a bomb. Here is what
was on it:&mdash;</p>

<h3>AFTER THE POLL.</h3>

<div class="poem width18">  <div class="stanza">
<p>After the poll is over,</p>
<p class="i2">After the voting's done,</p>
<p>Mudford will be much duller,</p>
<p class="i2">No more election fun.</p>
<p>But ONE man will be more happy,</p>
<p class="i2">Not so disturbed in his soul (?),</p>
<p><span class="sc">Winkins's</span> wife is come back now&mdash;</p>
<p class="i6">After the Poll!</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Of course, I should have destroyed the card at once&mdash;but I was out
when it came, and <span class="sc">Maria</span> read it first! What happened was a good
instance of the monstrous way in which one man's sin is another
man's punishment. In this case (1) it was my wife who had
persisted in going away, and (2) it was an unknown post-cardist
who had written the insulting doggerel. Yet I paid the entire
penalty.</p>

<p>The great puzzle&mdash;who is the seventh councillor?&mdash;is still unsolved.
All that has happened so far is that Mrs. <span class="sc">Letham Havitt</span> and Mrs.
<span class="sc">Arble March</span> are no longer on speaking terms. It has leaked out
that Mrs. <span class="sc">March</span> had more plumpers than Mrs. <span class="sc">Havitt</span>, whereupon
ructions&mdash;as <span class="sc">Jacky</span>, who has just come home for the Christmas
holidays says. I think he's quite right.</p>

<p>Our Parish Council meets next Monday&mdash;on the 7th. With the
New Year we commence our reign of beneficent activity. I need
hardly say that it is certain that I am to be Chairman. My position
on the poll suggests it, common decency demands it, moreover I expect
it. I refuse to believe that I shall be disappointed.</p>

<h2>THE WINTER ACADEMY OF 1995.</h2>

<p class="center1">(<em>An Elegant Extract from a Future Development.</em>)</p>

<p class="ind">The Committee this year has wisely been recruited from the
Master Bill Posters' Guild; the old-fashioned method of "hanging"
is abandoned, and advertisements are now "stuck" on the walls by
the New "B" Gum Process (for which Sir <span class="sc">J. Millboard</span> contributes
a charming illustration No. 20,000). During a preliminary survey,
we were astonished by the blatant excellence of the exhibition. "<em>A
Bicycle Made for Five</em>," by Mr. <span class="sc">Lowther R. Cade</span> (No. 2006), is
especially delicate and sudden; the tone is aluminium throughout,
and although no children are represented as bodily on the machine,
a Kineto-Phonograph inserted in the axle dexterously responds to a
penny in the slot&mdash;when the youthful athletes are both seen and
<em>heard</em> in the adjacent horse-pond. "<em>Gregory the Grateful</em>"
(No. 612) fully sustains Dr. <span class="sc">Utterson's</span> reputation for historical
advertisement; by pressing a spring the Pope actually swallows the
powder, and seems to like it. It is quite equal to this Master's
"<em>Columbus in Wall Street</em>" of last year. Mr. <span class="sc">G. Morland's</span>
"<em>Carter's Pill-gathering in the Old Kent Road</em>" (No. 69) is too
realistic for modern taste; the fine oaks in the background are
absolutely hidden by placards; but Lord <span class="sc">Boxall's</span> "<em>While there is
Life there is Soap</em>" (No. 15,000z) is truly impressionist; the life is full
of soap, and the soap full of life. In "<em>Glycerine</em>" (unnumbered), by
Miss <span class="sc">Topsy Turvy</span> (the Presidentess), we have a fine example of
"<em>The Newer Symbolism</em>,"&mdash;a patent revolving motor displays its
liquidity to equal advantage upside down.</p>

<p class="ind">Altogether the show is calculated to promote business&mdash;which is
the true end of Art; it also opens out infinite possibilities for house-decoration.</p>

<h2>HOW TO WRITE AN EXTRA NUMBER.</h2>

<p class="center1">(<em>An Up-to-date fragment for Yuletide.</em>)</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;"><a href="images/009b-550.png"><img src="images/009b-200.png" width="200" height="158" alt="The author was hard at work."
title="The author was hard at work." /></a></div>

<p>The author was hard at work. He heeded not the snow that beat
against the window, nor the wintry wind that whistled through the
leafless trees. The fire burned brightly in the grate, and the
shadows on the walls seemed to inspire him with seasonable tales.
He wrote for dear life, as his
copy was late, and he knew
that the printers were clamouring
for more and more
from his facile pen. Every
now and again he glanced at
a volume of drawings (there
were many sketches in the
book on his desk), and, pausing
for a moment, seemed to
be lost in thought. Then he
would resume his labours
with fresh energy. Very
rarely he would murmur to
himself, and then his words would be few.</p>

<p>"Confusion!" he muttered on one such occasion; "how the
Dickens (or should it be Thackeray?) am I to get in the Christmas
waits?" He pondered for a moment, and then his eyes glistened with
delight. "Eureka! I have it! They must appear in a dream. Yes,
that will get over the difficulty, they must appear in a dream!"</p>

<p>And then he continued his writing. During the whole day he had
been hard at work. His breakfast was scarcely touched. He waved
away the servant girl who would have set before him his lunch. It
was now close upon his customary dinner hour, but still he insisted
upon isolation. Even the wife of his devotion did not dare to come
near him. She knew that he would not speak to her, but only cast
at her a glance. But such a glance! A terrible tirade compressed
into a solitary look!</p>

<p>The short day waned and passed away. The evening quickly
changed into night. There were cheery songs without, as it was
Christmas Eve, when all men were thinking of wassail, and holly
and mistletoe. Even the performers in the forthcoming pantomime
were nearing the close of their last rehearsal, when they would go
back to their homes to count the mince pies and glance for the last
time at the cooking of the familiar plum pudding.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;"><a href="images/009c-400.png"><img src="images/009c-200.png" width="200" height="248" alt="'I will not disturb you,' said the caller, taking up a newspaper...."
title="'I will not disturb you,' said the caller, taking up a newspaper...." /></a></div>

<p>At length the writer was interrupted, and by his old familiar friend.</p>

<p>"I will not disturb you," said the caller, taking up a newspaper
and commencing its perusal; "I know
how busy you are, and will be silent as
Cornhill on a Sunday."</p>

<p>The writer nodded and continued his
work. His pen moved quicker and
quicker until at length it stopped.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" shouted the author. "At
last my task is completed. I have
brought in every cut and got through
the necessary number of lines. Yes, my
dear old comrade, I have done. The
printer will be satisfied, and the publisher
will cease to be alarmed. And
now, my dear fellow, I can enjoy Christmas
conscious of the fact that I have
thoroughly earned a holiday."</p>

<p>"Ah!" observed the visitor glancing at the recently-written
pages; "I see you have been writing something for Yuletide."</p>

<p>"Yuletide!" exclaimed the author. "Why, that was accomplished
ages ago. No, my dear fellow, I have just finished a summer
number timed to appear in August. I shan't think of touching the
work of next year's Christmas until April!"</p>

<h2>THE POLITE GUIDE TO THE CIVIL SERVICE.</h2>

<p class="center1">(<em>By an Affable Philosopher and Courteous Guide.</em>)</p>

<p class="title1b"><span class="sc">How to Receive a Deputation.</span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;"><a href="images/010b-370.png"><img src="images/010b-150.png" width="150" height="318" alt="Secretary of the Public Squander Department"
title="Secretary of the Public Squander Department" /></a></div>

<p>It does not take very long to make yourself quite at home as
Secretary of the Public Squander Department&mdash;the office I will suppose
you to be filling. You will find everything ready to your hand.
All you will have to remember is this&mdash;the
golden rule of the Service&mdash;that what was
done last year, should be followed this,
and arranged for next. Ministries may
come and Cabinets may go, but the
P. S. D. continues for ever. The policy of
the office must never be disturbed. If it
has been the custom (say) to put orange-trees
in the open spaces under the control
of the Department out to bloom in
February, under no consideration whatever
must the date be changed. It may
be advanced (generally in the newspapers
when there is nothing more interesting
ripe for discussion) that July would be
the better month. It may be declared
that an orange-tree taken from a hothouse
and thrust into the uncertain
atmosphere of the Metropolis, and indeed
the provinces, stands less chance of
weathering that climate in the second
month of the year than it would in the
seventh. That may be very true, but
what has been done by the Public
Squander Department once should be
repeated for ever. If an alteration has
to be made it must not be accomplished except "under-pressure."
Questions must be asked in the House, returns moved for, and all
the rest of it. So long as the alteration can be resisted, it is the duty
of every member of the Department to stand shoulder to shoulder to
oppose. You will find a case in point in the matter of your own pet
grievance the condition of "Milestones." You will recollect (if you
have a good memory) that "Milestones" were the steps of the staircase
that led you from the hall of Parliament to the comfortable
apartments reserved for the special use of the Secretary of the P. S. D.</p>

<p>"I do not think we need bother about those Milestones," you will
say to the Chief Clerk after you have got accustomed to your messengers
and have chosen your easiest of easy chairs; "I daresay there
are many matters of more pressing importance."</p>

<p>The courteous official to whom you have made the suggestion will
readily acquiesce, and then inform you that a deputation are anxious
to see you upon the subject. And here you will find one of the disadvantages
inseparably connected with making a question exclusively
your own. The moment you come into
power you are expected to do something.
It is of course unreasonable,
but none the less for that unavoidable.</p>

<p>"I think you had better see them,
Sir," the Chief Clerk will observe.
"They know the ropes fairly well, and
I do not think we shall get much
peace until you have got rid of them.
Of course, we have sent them travelling
a bit, but they have got back to
us at last."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px;"><a href="images/010c-400.png"><img src="images/010c-150.png" width="150" height="274" alt="'I think you had better see them, Sir,...'"
title="'I think you had better see them, Sir,...'" /></a></div>

<p>"Sent them a&mdash;travelling?" you
will query.</p>

<p>"Well, yes. We have referred them
to this department, where they have
been asked to apply to that. They
have been passed on from office to
office until they have come back to us.
It is the rule of the game. And now
I think the time has arrived when you
should see them in person."</p>

<p>Of course, you have nothing to
do but to take your subordinate's
advice. It is one of the regulations of the Civil Service that the tail
wags the dog. It stands to reason that a man who has grown
grey in the Department is more likely to know the business of the
bureau better than you who have just joined. So the spokesman of
the deputation receives a polite communication informing him that
you will be pleased to see him and his friends at such and such a
date. Of course, you are furnished with the names of the friends in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg 11]</span>
advance, and your private secretary (your right-hand
man) makes it his special business to post you up in all
that is necessary about them. The day arrives, and
with it the deputation. If the House is sitting, you can
see the Members in your own room. It looks well if you
can show your accosters how small a chamber you occupy,
and how hard at work you have to be at all hours of the
day and night. Failing a meeting in Parliament, you
can receive them in the Department itself. In this case
contrive, if possible, to see them in official uniform.
Chat with them after you have been to a <em>levée</em>, or Cabinet,
or something of that sort. It gives you a distinct
advantage if you can overawe them with the glories of a
well-feathered cocked-hat, and many yards (chiefly on
the back of your coat) of gold lace.</p>

<p>You will have, of course, in attendance upon you
several heads of departments. These gentlemen will say
nothing, but will look wonders. If you are at loss for
figures or facts, you will glance at them and make a bold
statement. That daring declaration will, of course, be
qualified with the announcement that it is made "to the
best of your belief." You will turn your face towards
the heads, and they will receive your mute appeal with
sympathetic attention. They will not say anything, but
will, I repeat, look wonders. They will not be comprehensible,
but merely convincing.</p>

<p>Chairs will have been set for the members of the deputation.
Some of your visitors will be personally known
to you, and these you will greet with effusion. Remember
that you must be nothing if not genial. Single out
for special cordiality the spokesman. Not, of course, one
of your parliamentary colleagues who is going to introduce
your visitors to you, but the principal member of the
deputation. If you have to contradict him in the course
of the interview you will have the sympathy of his colleagues,
and they will be glad to see one who has the
pleasure of your acquaintance (why should he have it
more than they?) soundly snubbed. After every one has
got comfortably into their places, you will ask if the
Press are to be present. If the reply is in the affirmative
(as it most probably will be, as all deputations like to see
themselves in print), continue your generalities, and say
with a good-natured laugh, "that you must be on your
guard." If the interview is not to be reported, then you
require no further guide. You can say or do almost anything
in reason. But assuming that the reporters are to
be present (and here it may be observed that, if your
private secretary knows his business, the gentlemen of
the Press will to some extent be "selected"), you must
be more careful.</p>

<p>You will listen to your parliamentary colleague's speech
of introduction and the address of your friend the spokesman
with many silent tokens of goodwill. When there
is a trace of a compliment you will smile and bow, and
if any figures are introduced you will ask to have them
repeated, and make a note of them on a piece of paper.
It does not matter what kind of paper you use, as the
piece will subsequently disappear into the basket reserved
for valueless documents.</p>

<p>You will ask several questions, and, when the spokesman
has completed his harangue, you will look round to
see if anyone desires to follow him. If there is any
hesitation, commence your reply at once. But if anyone
is ready, let him speak. It is far better that the eloquence
of the deputation should come out (like the measles)
rather than be suppressed. When your visitors have had
their turn, then will come yours.</p>

<p>Of course the less you say the better. I do not mean
in words, but in purport. If you have time you can
chatter for an hour, but that chatter should be absolutely
innocuous. Remember not to give yourself away.
Mind, you are bound in office by nothing you have
uttered out of it. Be genial. Indulge in small jokes.
Let them be at your own expense. Complain that you are
powerless. Explain that had you your way you would do
all sorts of good things, but "that tyrant, the Chancellor
of the Exchequer," interferes. It is not the fault of the
Public Squander Department; but the crime of the
Treasury. Wind up by assuring the members of the
deputation of your personal sympathy, and assure them
that you will take "an early opportunity of laying the
representations they have made before your colleagues."</p>

<p>By following these directions you may be sure that you
will gain golden opinions. You will be thanked with effusion
for your courtesy, and your visitors will retire entirely
satisfied with the reception that has been accorded to them.</p>

<p>"Return again <em>Whittington</em>, Pantomime of London" were the
words to the chimes that on or about Boxing Day must have been
ringing in the ears of Mr. Ex-Sheriff <span class="sc">Harris</span>, Knight, and spectacle
maker from morn to dawn. This is not the first time that our own
<span class="sc">Druriolanus</span> has chosen the intermittent Lord Mayor (for did not <em>Dick</em>
pass the chair thrice?) as the subject for his annual. That he has
been wise in making the selection has been proved by the result. Sir
<span class="sc">Augustus</span> (with the assistance of his literary colleagues, Messrs. H.
<span class="sc">Hamilton</span> and <span class="sc">Walter Raleigh</span>; and his chief of the staff, Mr.
<span class="sc">Arthur Collins</span>) has beaten his own record. Nothing better than
the present show has been seen at Drury Lane within the recollection
of the existing generation. And it is highly probable that the
memory of man does not, anent times past, run to the contrary.</p>

<p>The ex-sheriff has begun a new lease of the old house, and seemingly
has taken the success he has so long established on the
premises as one of the fixtures. A most excellent commencement to
a contract that should be highly satisfactory to both manager and
public.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/012b-1500.png"><img src="images/012b-600.png" width="600" height="213" alt="'Haul by the Sea.'"

<p class="center">"Haul by the Sea."</p></div>

<p>So much for pantomimic things in general, and now to turn to
details in particular. The book of the words is decidedly a superior
article. Hitherto when the Drury Lane Annual has contained a
fault the mistake has been discovered in "the cackle." On former
occasions it has been said (by the dyspeptic and consequently disappointed)
that "the turns of the halls" have been too numerous.
Those excellent comedians Messrs. <span class="sc">Dan Leno</span> and <span class="sc">Herbert Campbell</span>
have sometimes been a little too much in evidence to suit every
taste. In 1894-95 they have plenty to do, but only enough to satisfy
the most fastidious. They are quite as amusing as usual, and when
the curtain falls before "the transformation" people are rather inclined
to ask for more than to say that they have had quite enough.
This is the token of a good sign. Then the Brothers <span class="sc">Griffiths</span> are
particularly pleasing. That member of the brethren who plays the cat
is at once comic and pathetic. He makes <em>Malkin</em> quite a loveable
character. Then Miss <span class="sc">Ada Blanche</span>, as <em>Dick</em>, is altogether a hero
of romance. She may sing the old songs of the halls, but she tempers
her comic vocalism with a touch of sentiment that makes the whole
world kin after it has had its grin. Miss <span class="sc">Marie Montrose</span>, too, is
winsome, and so are Misses <span class="sc">Agnes Hewitt</span>, <span class="sc">Eva Westlake</span>, and
<span class="sc">Madge Lucas</span>. In fact, the opening is well played by "all concerned."
It is a wonder that, after the first innings of the morning performance,
they should have scored so heavily in the evening's representation.
But score they do, and are likely to "continue the movement"
until Easter.</p>

<p>The scenery must be seen. It baffles description. Who could
paint the sun? Who could
report the wonders of the
solar system? A first impressionist
would declare that
the gorgeous production of
colour, light, and form, could
only be adequately suggested
by the word "<span class="sc">Harris</span>." So
the entire audience thought
on Boxing Night. Let it be
known that after the wonderful
"Feast of Lanterns"
Scene, Sir <span class="sc">Augustus</span> was called
to the front three or four times,
and might have "gone on"
indefinitely so far as the house
was concerned. Indeed, the
enthusiasm showed no sign of
diminution when the lessee had
made his exit. Still the Gallery called for "'<span class="sc">Arris!</span>" still the Stalls
expressed their opinion by the gentle tapping of well-gloved hands.
Nay more, there were members of the superior classes who not only
rapped out their applause, but roared with laughter. From first
to last, thanks to a thoroughly appreciative (and yet discriminating)
audience, the play went admirably.</p>

<p>So the bells will ring for <em>Whittington</em> for a long time to come.
And where the belles are there will be found the beaux. To continue
the association of ideas, the shot of Sir <span class="sc">Augustus</span> has ended in
a hit. It does not take a prophet to predict that <em>Dick</em> will not only
be the centre of numberless <em>matinées</em>, but the hero of at least a
hundred nights. <em>Dick</em> will listen to his bells until Easter changes
the music.</p>
